# A sample of rspec code using rspec-mocks

## What is it.

This sample code is the rspec one of the book Rails3 recipebook. It is written by using rspec-mocks 2.14.6, so it uses test doulble. Originally, in this book, stub, stub_model and mock_model are used, however these expressions are old in rspec-mocks 2.14.6, so I rewrited the code.

## How to run this test code

$ bundle update
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec entry_rspec.rb

## Warning

I am a beginner about stub and mock, so there may be some mistakes. Especially, the last test of the test code seems to be wrong.
